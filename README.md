# zippers-on-derivatives

This is the repository for the artifact associated with Zippers on Derivatives authored by Rachel Pham as part of a final year undergraduate dissertation.

This artifact includes 3 implementations:
- Matching and lexing with zippers from Efficient Parsing with Derivatives and Zippers (Edelmann)
- Matching and lexing with zippers using the method from Parsing with Zippers (A Functional Pearl) (Darragh and Adams)
- Matching and lexing with derivatives (Urban, Sulzmann and Lu)
